This is an attempt to port the successful C#/WPF based Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning and Re-Reckoning Save Editor my brother and I wrote at https://github.com/mburbea/koar-item-editor to React, TypeScript and Electron (in the hope that the use of these more familiar technologies may spur more user contributions/PRs).

At this time we absolutely recommend people continue using the C# based editor as this editor is very much still under construction.
