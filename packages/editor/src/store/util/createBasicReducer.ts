/**
 * A large number of redux reducers simply take a set of actions in which the `payload` is
 * used to update an associated property.
 *
 * Given an initial state, a dictionary mapping action types to property names,
 * (and optionally a dictionary of other reducer methods compatible with `require('redux-actions').handleActions`),
 * this method returns a basic reducer which updates those properties.
 * @param initialState An initial state for the store.
 * @param propertyMap A dictionary mapping action types to property names.
 * @param partial Optionally, a dictionary of other reducer methods compatible with `require('redux-actions').handleActions`
